// In this file we are going to learn about Comments in C.
// Comments are explanations or annotations in the source code that are intended to be read by programmers.
// Comments are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters. The compiler treats them as white space.

// Comments in C can be made by adding "//" and "/*" in front of the text like this.

// This is a single line Comment

/*
This is
a multiline
Comment.
*/
#include <stdio.h>

// Example of comments in Hello, World
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!"); // Here I am printing "Hello, World!"
    return 0;
}

// Thats it for this lecture. Thanks for learning C with me.
// Homework: Try to comment many codes as you can.
